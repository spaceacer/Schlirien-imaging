# Schlirien-imaging
I'm an undergraduate student currently learning compressible fluid dynamics, and I was fascinated by the concept of visualising air density variationsâ€”something thatâ€™s normally invisible to the naked eye.

To explore this further, I decided to build a Schlieren imaging setup at home using simple, low-cost materials. This project helped me understand:

    How light rays bend in regions of varying refractive index (due to changes in air density)

    How real experimental techniques connect with fluid mechanics theory

    How to design and troubleshoot an optical setup

ðŸ”¬ What I Built

The setup includes:

    A concave mirror (a repurposed shaving mirror)

    A point light source (LED)

    A knife edge

    A camera (mobile phone) to record the flow

Using this, I was able to capture phenomena like the thermal plumes from a lighter flame, and observe how air flows interact and create density gradients.
ðŸŽ“ What I Learned

    Schlieren techniques provide a direct visualisation of fluid behaviour in compressible flows

    Hands-on experimentation gave me deeper insight into classroom theory

    Itâ€™s possible to do meaningful fluid mechanics experiments with minimal resources
